# Hypothesizing-Linearity
What if I told you that I can show you how ease it is the understand hypothesizing linearity with few python lines and logic calculation on understanding it?

Before we begin I am assuming you know what hypothesis is, Type I & type II errors, incase you forget this can help  
**type I error** - is like convicting an innocent person
**type II error** - is like failing to convict a guilty person

Now that we cleared the base of hypothesis what is linearity? in wikipedia  Linearity is the property of a mathmatical relationship that can be graphically represented as a straight line.
   in my know definition "is a straight-line relationship given values"

To test linearity of a given value we start assume that there is approximately a linear relationship between X and Y (in this example we will use X to represent Unemployment rate and Y the Weekly Sales). Mathematically we express this as 
     Y ≈ β0 + β1X
     
    Weekly Sales = β0 + β1 x Unemployment
    
β0 and β1 are both know are coefficients or paramteres.
